# Puzzle Design

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an interactive 3x3 puzzle game based on MacMahon Squares, where players must arrange and rotate pieces so that adjacent edges match correctly.

## 🎮 How to Play

Click on a piece to rotate it (90° per click).

Arrange all 9 pieces in a 3x3 grid.

Ensure that the edges match with adjacent pieces.

Once completed, the puzzle is solved!

## ⚙️ Features

Interactive UI with draggable and rotatable pieces.

Automated Solver to find valid solutions computationally.

Grid-based Layout for easy arrangement.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

Clone the Repository:

git clone: (https://github.com/Harsh-TG/Puzzle_Pattern.git)
cd Puzzle-Design

### Run the Java Program:

javac PuzzleSolver.java
java PuzzleSolver

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (Swing) - For GUI-based interaction.

Backtracking Algorithm - For computational solving.

Git & GitHub - Version control and collaboration.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

Add drag-and-drop support.

Extend the puzzle to a 4x4 grid.

Improve graphics and animations.
